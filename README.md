## Steps before you start coding

1. Clone down the repository using `git clone <repo-name>`
2. Install `yarn` on your machine. (Preferably using Homebrew)
3. cd into the repository folder and run `yarn install` in order to install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file
4. Once you're done, you can run the app using `yarn start`. This will run the app on localhost:3000/
5. Any change you make in the codebase will be automatically reflected on the web-app when you hit save. (This is called hot-reloading)

Lastly, make sure that any code you write is on your own branch. We will follow the git-flow that we discussed to collaborate on this project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
